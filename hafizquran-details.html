                  <h3>Problems</h3>
                  <p>
                    Many Muslims, eager to independently memorize the Quran,
                    face a significant challenge in assessing the fluency and
                    accuracy of their recitation without external guidance. A
                    considerable number of these individuals lack access to a
                    teacher or mentor who can listen and provide feedback on
                    their memorization efforts. To address this predicament, the
                    HafizQuran website has been developed, aiming to facilitate
                    Muslims in their independent Quranic memorization journey.
                    The platform offers a range of features, including tools for
                    memorization assistance, the submission of memorized verses,
                    proficiency assessments, and a wealth of informative
                    articles and events. By providing a supportive online
                    environment, HafizQuran strives to enhance the memorization
                    experience for those who may not have access to traditional
                    teaching methods, serving as a valuable resource on their
                    memorization journey.

                <h3>Process</h3>
                <h5>My Role is as a coder</h5>
                <p>
                  In my dual role as a Full Stack Developer and UI/UX Designer,
                  the project's process unfolded with a series of
                  responsibilities. To begin, I designed the user interface
                  meticulously using Figma, ensuring a visually appealing and
                  user-friendly design. The next step involved translating this
                  design into functional code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
                  blending aesthetics with seamless functionality.
                  Simultaneously, I took charge of crafting the project's
                  database structure, designing it with efficiency and
                  scalability in mind using MySQL. This step laid the groundwork
                  for robust data management throughout the application. In the
                  backend development phase, I seamlessly integrated the user
                  interface with the database, employing PHP and MySQL for a
                  cohesive and responsive system. This collaborative effort
                  between design and development elements aimed to create an
                  engaging and efficient user experience without compromising on
                  the project's technical integrity.

                      shape the user interface, ensuring a visually appealing
                      and responsive website.

                      is instrumental in designing and structuring the database,
                      providing a robust foundation for storing and retrieving
                      data efficiently. MySQL plays a crucial role in managing
                      the backend data operations seamlessly.

                <h3>The Challenges</h3>
                <p>
                  In tackling this project, I encountered a couple of key
                  challenges. Firstly, this marked my initial venture into
                  website development. Given that it was my first project, I
                  faced the inherent learning curve of transforming design ideas
                  into a fully functional website. Additionally, I took on the
                  dual role of UI/UX designer and full-stack developer.
                  Balancing these responsibilities meant juggling the creation
                  of an intuitive user interface with delving into the
                  complexities of backend development. Despite these hurdles,
                  this experience served as a valuable learning opportunity,
                  helping me refine my skills across different aspects of
                  website creation.
