                <p>
                  Jalur is an app that assist occupational drivers in practicing
                  their faith by identifying and suggesting mosques along the
                  route based on their location and local prayer times.

                <p>
                  In December of 2023, Jalur was selected as the most impactful
                  application and became the representative of Apple Developer
                  Academy @Infinite Learning Batam

                <h3>Problems</h3>
                <p>
                  Occupational drivers often work long hours, sometimes up to 20
                  hours a day, while traveling across the country. They face a
                  pressing challenge in identifying nearby mosques along their
                  routes and aligning with the respective prayer times.
                  Compounded by their unfamiliarity with the areas they traverse
                  and the varying prayer schedules across Indonesia, some
                  drivers resort to praying on the sidewalk. This underscores
                  the critical need for a solution that provides them with
                  information about the nearest mosques along their journey,
                  including accurate prayer timings, ensuring they can fulfill
                  their religious obligations more seamlessly.

                <h3>Process</h3>
                <h5>My Role is as a lead coder</h5>
                <p>
                  In my role as the lead coder, I guided and led a team of
                  developers throughout the project. Before implementation, I
                  conducted research to assess technical feasibility, ensuring a
                  solid foundation for our coding efforts. A significant
                  contribution was designing an algorithm to identify nearby
                  mosques based on the user's location and prayer times. To
                  enhance user experience, I integrated MapKit and the
                  UserNotification framework, improving the app's functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Recognizing the importance of background processes, I
                  successfully implemented this functionality, enriching the
                  app's capabilities. Leveraging GitHub, I meticulously managed
                  branches, ensuring a smooth and collaborative development
                  process. This multifaceted role allowed me not only to
                  contribute technically to the project but also to lead and
                  guide the development team, fostering a cohesive and
                  productive work environment.

                  followed by a thorough analysis of the data. Subsequently, we

                    <p>
                      In the initial version of Jalur, based on our research and
                      interviews with drivers in Indonesia, we discovered that
                      many face difficulty finding suitable rest areas while
                      driving, leading to risks of fatigue and microsleep.
                      Moreover, irregular drivers often pass by gas stations,
                      rest areas, or other rest stops without realizing it due
                      to unfamiliar routes. They assume there is another gas
                      station ahead, but in reality, there might not be,
                      compelling them to continue the journey without a break,
                      increasing the risk of accidents.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <div class="version-item">
                    <h4><i class="bi bi-tag-fill"></i>v0.2.0</h4>
                    <p>
                      In this version, we refined our focus by delving deeper
                      into the issues identified during testing and feedback
                      collection. Through analysis, we uncovered specific edge
                      cases prevalent in Indonesia, particularly concerning
                      occupational drivers who work long hours on the road.
                      These individuals face the challenge of finding suitable
                      places for their daily five prayers. Given that they
                      travel to different regions every day, each with its
                      unique prayer times, they encounter difficulty estimating
                      the locations of mosques for their prayers. Consequently,
                      they are sometimes compelled to pray on sidewalks or end
                      up missing their prayer times.

                      This exploration and understanding of the nuanced
                      challenges led us to a more detailed comprehension of the
                      specific needs of occupational drivers, informing further
                      refinements in our solution.

                      In this version, we aimed to simplify the design while
                      introducing valuable enhancements. We incorporated parking
                      area data into the information and recommendation
                      algorithm for mosque searches. This addition was prompted
                      by feedback indicating that occupational drivers, such as
                      logistics and truck drivers, often navigate large vehicles
                      and require parking spaces. Many of them abandon the
                      intention to pray at a mosque due to inadequate parking
                      facilities. Subsequently, we conducted AB testing and user
                      testing to gather feedback for the next iteration. This
                      iterative approach ensures that our solution aligns more
                      closely with the practical needs and preferences of our
                      users.

                    <p>
                      In the final version of Jalur, we focused on refining the
                      user experience to be more straightforward and
                      user-friendly. Additionally, we introduced animations and
                      illustrations to enhance the application's user interface.
                      We optimized the mosque search algorithm along the travel
                      route and incorporated new features such as trip
                      scheduling and history. These updates were based on
                      valuable insights gathered from previous user testing,
                      ensuring that the application aligns seamlessly with user
                      preferences and delivers a more engaging and efficient
                      experience.

                <p>
                  Implementing MapKit and CoreLocation into our application
                  posed a significant challenge for both myself and the team.
                  Prior to this project, none of us had hands-on experience in
                  integrating mapping services, making it a learning curve that
                  required dedicated effort and collaboration. Overcoming this
                  obstacle marked a valuable milestone in our journey.

                  Ensuring Jalur could adeptly handle scenarios like route
                  changes, delays, and early arrivals at the destination mosque
                  required crafting intricate algorithms. This task, though
                  challenging, proved to be a rewarding experience that honed my
                  technical and user experience skills.

                  Jalur, my debut app on the App Store, faced its share of
                  hurdles during the submission process, leading to an initial
                  rejection. Collaborating with the team, I successfully
                  addressed the issues raised during the review, underlining our
                  commitment to delivering a high-quality product.
